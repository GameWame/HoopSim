# 🏀 HoopSim: An AR Basketball Simulator for HoloLens 2 🏀

HoopSim is an augmented reality basketball shooting simulator developed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2, created as a Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science.

---

## 🎯 About The Project

The goal of HoopSim is to create a realistic and engaging basketball simulation that leverages the unique capabilities of the HoloLens 2. By using hand-tracking and spatial awareness, the application allows users to place a virtual basketball hoop in their physical space and practice shooting with natural hand movements.

The project serves as a practical demonstration of developing interactive, physics-based experiences for cutting-edge augmented reality hardware.

## ✨ Core Features

* **Intuitive Hand-Tracking**: Uses the HoloLens 2's advanced hand-tracking to check the hand position and height before and after shooting.
* **Spatial Mapping**: Allows the user to anchor the virtual basketball hoop to any real-world surface.
* **Eye-Tracking**: Verifies if the user is looking at the hoop during each shot.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **Engine**: Unity 3D
* **Framework**: Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) for Unity
